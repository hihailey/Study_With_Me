## Study With Me

ðŸ“š Study With Me is a free streaming web app trying to help isolated students or people working from home to feel less alone without the burden of keeping a conversation going. Its main goal is to bring people together in a safe and productive environment. The idea comes from a growing trend on streaming websites where users upload footage of themselves studying. 

Our app is quick to set up, and you are connected to a study buddy instantly. To ensure safety and accountability we require all of our users to be on camera during study sessions, this also encourages personal connections through face-to-face engagement.
